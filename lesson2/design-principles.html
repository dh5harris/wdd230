        <p>
          Contrast is designing a distinct difference between the colors of the
          foreground and background. Wes Bos's website does this very well. He
          primarily only uses three colors: white. black, and yellow. The white
          on black, black on white, and black on yellow provide some of the best
          contrast ratios.

        <p>
          White space or as others call it negitive space is the area between
          elements on a website. It gives speration and keeps things from being
          to crowded The color does not have to be white. It can be any color.
          BYU Pathway's website makes great use of white space by keeping the
          design simple and clean feeling. There is nothing that is distracting
          on the site.

        <p>
          Proximity is used to show a relationship between items. Amazon uses
          proimity to group items that are in the same category.
